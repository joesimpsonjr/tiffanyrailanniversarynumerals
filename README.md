# Tiffany Rail Anniversary Numerals
## Web Font Creation

Collaboration with talent LA-based <a href="http://tiffanyhuang.com/">Designer Tiffany Huang</a> to bring her font, originally designed to commemorate the <a href="http://metro25.squarespace.com/">25th Anniversary of Metro Rail's return to Los Angeles</a> on July 14, 2015. 

Initially designed as a multi-color character set and intended for a jQuery counter effect, I persuaded the designer and department client to go with one color (a color font could be achieved through creating each color as a layer then stacked each via CSS and SASS.In addiion, the counter effect requires numbers and a mulitlayered data file/web icon would not register as a single character for the math required in the function.
